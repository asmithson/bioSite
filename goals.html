      <!-- 1st Goal -->
      <div class="goal-entry">
        <img src="images/learningstyle.jpg" alt="Milestone: Practicing Curls">
        <div class="goal-text">
          <p>
            One of Rose T.'s earliest milestones in beauty school came during curl
            practice. Styling curls with precision is no small feat — it reflects
            technique, patience, and an understanding of hair texture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rose T. hopes to continue refining these skills to master more complex
            curl patterns and textured styles.

      <!-- 2nd Goal -->
      <div class="goal-entry">
        <img src="images/braidingpractice.jpg" alt="Self-braiding Success!">
        <div class="goal-text">
          <p>
            Braiding someone else's hair is one thing. Braiding your own takes a
            different kind of skill. Rose T. celebrated a win when successfully
            braiding their own hair — a test of both dexterity and patience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking ahead, Rose T. is excited to explore more intricate braiding
            patterns and incorporate them into creative color work and formal
            styling for events like weddings.

      <!-- 3rd Goal -->
      <div class="goal-entry">
        <img src="images/grad_day.jpg" alt="Graduation Day">
        <div class="goal-text">                
          <p>
            Graduation wasn't just a finish line — it marked courage, growth, and a
            complete transformation. Rose T. left behind a stable career to follow
            their passion, and this photo celebrates that achievement.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a license in hand and real-world experience underway, Rose T. is
            focused on building a strong foundation in the salon world — with the
            long-term goal of becoming a color specialist and styling expert for
            vivid hues and special occasions.

      <!-- Shoutout -->
      <div class="shoutout">
        <img src="images/partnerflowers.jpg" alt="Quiet Thanks to Their Support">
        <p>
          This bouquet quietly honors the support Rose T. received along the way.
          Given to them by their partner and classmates on graduation day, the
          flowers reflect more than a milestone — they represent shared pride,
          encouragement, and the meaningful bonds built throughout the journey. A
          quiet reminder that even bold transformations are rarely done alone.
